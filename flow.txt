FLOW:

1. Website opens
2a. Create game button pressed
	FRONTEND NEEDS TO:
		send GameId(?), StartTime, HostPlayerId(?), GamePassword, GameName, PlayerName
        (?) ids easier to make in frontend or backend?
    BACKEND NEEDS TO:
        1. check if GameName already exists
                if it already exists, return -1
                else, store data in game table and add player to player table


2b. Join game button pressed
    FRONTEND NEEDS TO:
        send PlayerId(?), GameName, TeamNumber, isLeader, PlayerName
    BACKEND NEEDS TO:
        look up GameName
            if it exists, add given data to player table and return 1
            else, return -1
    FRONTEND NEEDS TO:
        check for return value and display message/ screen accordingly
